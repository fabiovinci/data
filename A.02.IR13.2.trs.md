# Temporal Reference System

**Purpose**

Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.
This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.


**Test method**

iso19108 (5.3.1) states: "the metadata associated with a data set that uses
temporal reference systems other than the Gregorian calendar and UTC shall either provide citations to documents
that describe those temporal reference systems, or include description of those temporal reference systems in the
metadata" and "The reference to the temporal reference system can be introduced in the feature catalogue or the metadata associated with an application schema or dataset."

This requirement needs further specification to become machine testable.
